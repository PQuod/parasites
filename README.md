Visual white noise generator

I needed a tool that could generate white noise in order to print a 1mx1m poster to accompagny a performance about the manuscript I'm writing. This white noise generator allows you to select the pixel size you prefer. 
Some lines in comments also allows you to change the size of the image you'll generate, as this tool was primarily made to build a printed image. These lines have been passeed in comments here for it reduces the "aesthetic" experience.
Best in full screen (after a refreshment).
